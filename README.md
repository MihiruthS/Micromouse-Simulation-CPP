# Micromouse Simulation for SLIIT RoboFest 2024

This repository contains the micromouse maze-solving algorithm developed for **SLIIT RoboFest 2024**. We used this simulation to test and fine-tune the algorithm before implementing it on the physical micromouse robot.

## Algorithm Overview

The simulation utilizes the **floodfill algorithm** to:  
- Navigate the robot from the starting point to the center of the 16x16 maze.  
- Return the robot back to the starting point after reaching the center.

## How to Run

1. **Install the MMS Simulation:**  
   Follow the installation steps provided in the [MMS Simulation Repository](https://github.com/mackorone/mms). 

2. **Clone this repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/MihiruthS/Micromouse-Simulation-CPP/>
   ```
3. **Use the MMS simulation to compile and run the test2.cpp file**

## Acknowledgment
We would like to thank the developers of the MMS platform for providing this invaluable platform to test and validate the algorithm.
